# **An Online Cookbook Project**


This project was built for the purposes of one of my personal projects ("milestone projects") at Code Institute.

This was a data-centric development project: the requirements were:

>build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

Or, slightly more specifically:

>Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

There were a few project ideas suggested, and I chose to try and create an online cookbook.
