# **An Online Cookbook Project**


This project was built for the purposes of one of my personal projects ("milestone projects") at Code Institute.

This was a data-centric development project: the requirements were:

>build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

Or, slightly more specifically:

>Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

There were a few project ideas suggested, and I chose to try and create an online cookbook.

## **Design and Features**

### **Project Purpose**

In addition to what was already mentioned above, like the data 
handling infrastrucutre (building a MongoDB-backed Flask-based web app), 
the core focus of the project is providing a CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) functionality for a user 
through a main navigation menu and a structured layout.

In other words:

>create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records

and also hopefully do that in a both visually appealing and user friendly manner (ease of use).


#### **_User Stories_**

External userâ€™s goals:

- Find and share recipes
- The site is visually catchy and easy enough and simple to use
- The site offers some kind of browse-through list or gallery of recipes, with recipe images included

### **Design**
