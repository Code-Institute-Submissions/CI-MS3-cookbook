# **An Online Cookbook Project**


This project was built for the purposes of one of my personal projects ("milestone projects") at Code Institute.

This was a data-centric development project: the requirements were:

>build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

Or, slightly more specifically:

>Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

There were a few project ideas suggested, and I chose to try and create an online cookbook.

## **Design and Features**

### **Project Purpose**

In addition to what was already mentioned above, like the data 
handling infrastrucutre (building a MongoDB-backed Flask-based web app), 
the core focus of the project is providing a CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) functionality for a user 
through a main navigation menu and a structured layout.

In other words:

>create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records

and also hopefully do that in a both visually appealing and user friendly manner (ease of use).


#### **_User Stories_**

External userâ€™s goals:

- Find and share recipes
- The site is visually catchy and easy enough and simple to use
- The site offers some kind of browse-through list or gallery of recipes, with recipe images included

### **Design**

#### **_Wireframes_**
Some (staggeringly) crude wireframes (yep, I do (still) use a pen(cil) and paper)) can be 
seen here:
- [main/index page](wireframes/sketch_main_page.JPG)
- [recipe list page](wireframes/sketch_recipe_list_page.JPG)
- [recipe card layout](wireframes/sketch_recipe_card.JPG)

MongoDB collection schema example for the project can be seen here:
- [MongoDB collection schema](wireframes/MS3_MongoDB_schema.JPG)

## **Technologies Used**

- **_IDE and code storage_**
    - GitPod - used as the online IDE
    - GitHub - for the storage of the code online
- **_Back-End_**
    - Python 3
        - Flask
        - Jinja
        - PyMongo
        - DNSPython
- **_Database_**
    - MongoDB Atlas
- **_Front-End_**
    - HTML
    - CSS
        - Materialize
        - Material Icons
        - Font Awesome
    - JavaScript
        - jQuery

- **_Deployment_**
    - Heroku

## **Testing and Features Left to Implement**

### **Testing**

### **Features Left to Implement**

**_Carousel "randomizer"_**

Currently, the carousel and the index page displays all the images from the database, 
in the sequence in which they are stored in the database, which is chronologically. And the 
sequence resets - i.e. starts from the beginning - each time the index page is loaded.

So, if an image stored in the database last, it would go to the back of the carousel, and get displayed last. 
It's a FIFO principle, basically (**F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut - i.e. what is stored in the database 
first, is displayed out in the carousel first also).

With a larger number of entries, some of the images would in practice never get displayed, or more precicely, 
they would never get _seen_, as it could be not expected for a user to stay on the index page long enough for those 
particulary images to be displayed on the carousel.

Or, in other words, some of the images would not "get a fair chance to be seen". And the idea, or the desire, is that all 
images, which represent recipes, get treated equally in that regard.

I attempted to change the "step" option of the carousel - i.e. parameter which controls the image display pattern: default "step" is 1, 
which means the carousel displays the next image in the que. So if the "step" is set to, for instance, 3, the carousel would display every 
third image. But, that doesn't visually look right, becuase the transition to the following image doesn't render seamlessly, but it rather 
looks like the carousel is spinning at great speed until it reaches the desired image.

So a "carousel randomizer" is an idea where the carousel is set to display images in random sequence, and the sequence is randomized (or "shuffled") 
anew every time the index page is loaded.

**_Delete confirmation_**

Currently the delete button in the Edit Recipe form form is set up that you only press it once, and the recipe is deleted. I'd like to have an additional 
"delete confirmation" feature set up: when the delete button is pressed, a message would pop up (using a Materialize "modal", for instance) asking the user 
to confirm deletion.

**_Character restriciton_**

Currently, there is no character restriction in the forms, when adding a new recipe. Implementing such a feature might be beneficial, namely for such fields in 
the form as the recipe's name, and short description.

**_Further form styling_**

Maybe make the forms (for adding and editing recipes) more visually appeling, based on user feedback, in regards to typography, or button styling. Possibly adding further data entry fields about the recipes, such 
as serving, ingredients, course (main, side, starter, etc.), or meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

**_Search bar_**

Currently there is none.

### **Content**

Content on the index and About pages was written by me.

Recipes entered in the database at the moment of writting this, were taken from these sources:

- https://tasty.co/recipe/baked-avocado-eggs
- https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26728380/baked-pineapple-salmon-recipe/
- https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spaghetti-meatballs
- https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/257198/thin-crust-pizza-dough/
- https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chorizo-mozzarella-gnocchi-bake

### **Media**

All recipes images diplayed on the site as of the moment of writting this are rendered via their URL's, so a source 
for the image is always evident.

All the other images used, stored in the project on GitPod, are from:

- https://hipwallpaper.com/
- https://wallpaperaccess.com/

except for the 404 image, which is from:

- https://www.freepik.com/

Icons used are from:

- https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline
- https://fontawesome.com/
